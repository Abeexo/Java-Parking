# README - Java Parking Management System

This Java code provides a simple implementation of a parking management system that allows users to manage a parking lot by controlling car entries and exits based on a whitelist of license plates.
How to Use:

    Adding License Plates to Whitelist:
        The system prompts the user to input the number of license plates to be added to the whitelist.
        Users can input individual license plates to be whitelisted.
        Whitelisted plates are displayed after they've been added.

    Parking Management:
        Users are prompted to allow a car to enter (Y), exit (N), or quit (Q).
        To allow a car to enter, the user inputs the license plate of the car to permit entry.
        To allow a car to exit, the user inputs the license plate of the car to allow it to leave.
        Users can quit the system by selecting Q.

Improvements:

    Refined User Interaction:
        The system presents clear prompts for user actions (entry, exit, or quit) using a while loop.
        Input validation ensures correct user input when entering the number of plates for the whitelist.

    Enhanced Whitelisting and Management:
        Whitelisted plates are stored and displayed for reference.
        Cars are allowed to enter or exit based on their presence in the whitelist.
        The system provides appropriate feedback messages regarding entry, exit, or incorrect plate entries.

    Helper Methods and Refactoring:
        A helper method ensures valid integer input when entering the number of plates.
        Method names have been refactored for better readability without altering their functionality.

This code provides a basic demonstration of a parking system; however, it can be extended to include additional features such as more comprehensive error handling, enhanced security measures, and improved user interfaces for real-world applications.
Usage Notes:

    For the "Enter" or "Exit" prompts, enter "Y" or "N" respectively.
    To exit the system, input "Q".
    Follow the on-screen instructions for each action.

File Structure:

    Main.java: Contains the main method and user interaction logic.
    Parking.java: Defines the Parking class responsible for managing the parking system.

For further improvements, consider implementing more robust input validation, enhancing security measures, or integrating the system into a user-friendly graphical interface.

Feel free to expand this system by adding more features or refining the existing functionalities based on specific project requirements or real-world scenarios.
